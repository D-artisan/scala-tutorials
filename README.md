# Scala Tutorials

![Scala](https://img.shields.io/badge/Scala-DC322F?style=for-the-badge&logo=scala&logoColor=white)

A collection of beginner-friendly Scala tutorials to help you learn and master functional and object-oriented programming with Scala.

## About

This repository contains a series of Scala tutorials covering topics like variables, collections, functions, pattern matching, and more. Whether you're new to Scala or transitioning from another language, these tutorials provide clear explanations and hands-on examples.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Scala installed on your machine ([Download Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/))
- A build tool like `sbt` (Scala Build Tool) ([Install sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html))
- A code editor like IntelliJ IDEA with Scala plugin or Visual Studio Code (optional but recommended)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/D-artisan/scala-tutorials.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd scala-tutorials
   ```

## Usage
- Each tutorial is organized in its own file (e.g., `01_Variables.scala`, `02_Collections.scala`).
- To run a tutorial using `sbt`:
  1. Open the terminal in the project directory.
  2. Start the `sbt` console:
     ```bash
     sbt
     ```
  3. Compile and run a specific file:
     ```bash
     runMain <package>.<ObjectName>
     ```
     (Replace `<package>.<ObjectName>` with the actual package and object name from the file, e.g., `tutorials.Variables`.)
- Alternatively, use your IDEâ€™s "Run" feature if supported.
- Explore the code and modify it to experiment!

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-tutorial`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Add new tutorial on X"`).
4. Push to your branch (`git push origin feature/new-tutorial`).
5. Open a Pull Request.
